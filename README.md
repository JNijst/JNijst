- 👋 Hi, I’m @JNijst
- 👀 I’m interested in VR glove, inspired by the lucidglove $60
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Arduino
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Arduino DRV8860 to set 5 channels on/off (not steppermotor)

Hi I am Jules Nijst, pensioner and interested in a million things. I used to do some Pascal and database SQL 30 years ago, so I am not a newby.
I am trying to develop a VR glove, this consists of a physical part and now parts of it are operating...
Also the control-part: Chips and software.
I have decided which chips to use and want to use Arduino software, because a large library is available and if learned well, I can use it in other projects.
After testing it on a breadboard I intend to use easyeda and have to pcb built with components installed.
Eventually if all works; I'd like to give the project for free to someone who can do better for the VR community and make it cheaply commercially avialable.
